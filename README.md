# âš¡ Model Compression Techniques (PyTorch Overview)
Model compression is a set of techniques used to reduce the size and computational complexity of a model while preserving or even improving its performance.
This repository provides simple Google Colabâ€“ready examples that demonstrate **three core model compression techniques** used to optimize deep learning models for deployment on resource-constrained environments such as mobile devices, IoT hardware, and edge systems.

## ðŸš€ Techniques Covered

### 1. Pruning  
Pruning removes unnecessary weights or entire neurons/filters from a neural network. By introducing sparsity, it reduces computation and memory usage while maintaining performance.  
- **Unstructured pruning**: Removes individual weights.  
- **Structured pruning**: Removes entire neurons, channels, or filters.

### 2. Quantization  
Quantization reduces the precision of numerical representations (e.g., from 32-bit floating point to 8-bit integers). This significantly decreases model size and speeds up inference with minimal impact on accuracy.  
- **Post-training quantization**: Apply after model training.  
- **Quantization-aware training**: Train the model with quantization effects included.

### 3. Knowledge Distillation  
Knowledge Distillation compresses a large **teacher model** into a smaller **student model**. The student learns both from the original training data and from the teacherâ€™s predictions, allowing it to achieve strong performance with fewer parameters.

## âœ… Summary  
- **Pruning** â†’ Removes redundant parameters to create sparse models.  
- **Quantization** â†’ Reduces precision to optimize memory and speed.  
- **Knowledge Distillation** â†’ Transfers knowledge from large teacher models to compact student models.  

These three techniques are widely used in industry to deploy efficient, scalable AI models without sacrificing too much accuracy.
